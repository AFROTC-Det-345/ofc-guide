## TRAINING PROGRAM
### OVERVIEW
To develop quality leaders for the Air Force, each detachment relies primarily on its training program. The Operations Flight Commander (OFC) is responsible for managing this demanding yet rewarding program area. A key point to understand is that no two detachments are created alike. The facilities available,
number of crosstown universities involved, size of the Cadet Wing, and many other factors determine how the training program will take shape. Despite the differences in execution, all OFCs are responsible for certain administrative and training tasks. The purpose of this guide is to give you a checklist for initial success, along with some tips for continued high performance over the summer and into your first semester.

### INITIAL CHECKLIST FOR SUCCESS
Depending on whether you’ve attended IQT and whether you’re an Academy/ROTC/OTS graduate, your perspective on training and the specific role you play could vary. Assuming you arrive to the detachment over the summer, this checklist will help you develop your knowledge base and prepare for the coming
semester – using current instructions and the Holm Center Training philosophy. This initial checklist will take several days to several weeks to complete, so chip away at it slowly and reach out to others for help when necessary.

#### Step 1: Read applicable AFROTC Instructions
Current versions can be found on the ROTC team, [Stan-Eval (CCVE) channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3af3f8c5424b0040b2b3840b09780cd351%40thread.tacv2/CCVE%2520-%2520Stan-Eval?groupId=cb3abb7f-7504-4300-8e4f-30a968fbef22&tenantId=9f90e2a5-baf5-4a37-87bd-48acea06e6e2).  

You should focus on AFROTCI 36-2011 volumes 1 and 3.

Volume 1 focus on the LLAB curriculum and the objectives that must be met

Volume 3 describes your responsibilities and most of the other administrative information that goes along with Cadet Operations. Be very familiar with Chapter 10, as you will reference it all the time. 

Key points: Keep the e-copies of these publications on your desktop for quick reference. 95% of the situations you encounter and questions that cadets ask can be found in here. Also, know the minimum requirements. Once you’re sure that your Det fulfills the minimum intent of the regulations, that’s when you get to be creative. Your experience, insights, and ideas can go a long way in adding value to the training program.

Key Guidance:
  - [AFROTCI 36-2011 Vol 1, *LLAB Curriculum 2022-2023*](https://airuniversity.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/ROTC/Shared%20Documents/CCVE/Instructions/AFROTCI%2036-2011%20Vol%201%20LLAB%20Curriculum%202022%20-%202023.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=6qM4Qu)

  - [AFI36-2905_AFROTCSUP](https://airuniversity.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/ROTC/Shared%20Documents/CCVE/Instructions/AFI%2036-2905%20AFROTC%20SUP%20Fitness%20Program.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=72ZHBH)
  - [DAFI36-2903_AFROTCSUP](https://airuniversity.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/ROTC/Shared%20Documents/CCVE/Instructions/DAFI%2036-2903_AFROTCSup.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=DpHhO6)

#### Step 2: Know the Self-Assessment Program (SAP) Checklists Backwards and Forwards
Now that you’ve reviewed the information that will help you know your job, it’s time to test yourself with the SAP Checklists. When your Compliance Inspection (CI) occurs, the Assessment Team will use these checklists.  You should be able to provide detailed answers about how you’re meeting standards and should be able to quickly cross-reference everything in the regulations.

The current versions of all SAP Checklists are found on the ROTC team, Stan-Eval (CCVE) channel. Ensure you’re always using the most up-to-date checklists.

Use the semi-annual checklist as you prepare go through each semester.  This will ensure that you meet all the requirements each semester.

Key points: Documentation is critical! You may think you’re meeting requirements, but without being able to show anything to an inspector, it may be perceived that you’re not.  Your “evidence” should clearly show how you are meeting the requirements.

#### Step 3: Review Your Continuity Folder/Book & Local Documents
It’s helpful to review these documents while learning the regulations, because you’ll see why your predecessor included certain things. It’s a natural tendency to want to make changes and improvements to things right away but move slowly. Your predecessor had valid reasons for maintaining them the way he or she did, so there may be practical advantages to their current formats.

#### Step 4: Know Where to Turn for Help
If you don’t understand something while reviewing all the previous information and your turnover has already departed, tap into the OFC network. There is an AFROTC Operations Flight Commander Facebook group that fleshes out issues all the time. Another great resource is your Region’s DO. This individual will consolidate and distribute information for all Region OFCs. Get added to the email distro list and don’t be afraid to reach out.
 
## SHIFTING SIGHTS TO YOUR FIRST SEMESTER
With your knowledge base established, it’s time to get to work for the upcoming semester. Your predecessor should have selected a Cadet Wing Commander (CW/CC) prior to departing. You’ll need to work with the CW/CC extensively, and the summer is a great time to do so. You’ll never have as much time as you do over the summer months, so use it wisely before the hectic school year begins. The following sections discuss some of the things you’ll need to consider prior to the start of the semester.

### The Cadet Wing Commander
#### Initial Interactions
You’ll need to reach out to your CW/CC over the summer to begin planning for the upcoming semester. Many of the items in the next section (Required Documentation) should be started and/or completed long before the semester rolls around. Remember, that the CW/CC needs your help and guidance – much of your time will be spent providing direction and helping him/her work through problems. It is recommended that you perform initial, midterm, and final formal counseling sessions, and the summer and winter breaks are a great time to lay out your expectations.
Accountability

It is critical that you hold the CW/CC accountable from the very beginning. Be clear on what you want. Make it known that, at least for the time being, he/she is “not one of them.” In other words, they are in charge and may have to make difficult decisions regarding their peers/friends.

There will be cadets within the wing who fall short on their responsibilities. It is important to show that this reflects on the CW/CC. Push the CW/CC to figure out how to correct the behavior. Almost every situation can be a training opportunity.

### Meetings
It is strongly recommended that you meet regularly over the breaks and at least once per week during the semester with the CW/CC, to discuss LLAB for the week and approve the following week’s OPORD. Be sure to keep a balanced approach when deciding whether to jump in or simply let the results of his/her decisions unfold. If no unacceptable mission impact will result, it’s okay to let the CW/CC fail. But you must capitalize on the opportunity to provide feedback and foster growth afterwards. Always show that you support them in public.

### Required Documentation

### Operations Plan (OPLAN)
The CW/CC takes your strategic guidance and generates the OPLAN. The OPLAN provides operational-level guidance for all cadets in the wing. It is produced by the CW/CC and approved by the OFC each semester.

See AFROTCI 36-2011 for specific requirements.

### Operations Orders (OPORDs)
From the operational-level guidance provided in the OPLAN, the CW/CC is responsible for overseeing the creation of the OPORD for all mandatory Practical Military Training (PMT). The OPORD is what most cadets will see…it specifies the uniform of the day, location, time, Risk Management (RM) factors, and other details for each event. It is the tactical- level guidance that is too detailed for the OPLAN.

Ensure RM is conducted for the specific activities that will be covered. DO NOT allow the CW/CC to cut and paste the same RM assessment from one week to the next.

### Organizational Chart
The CW/CC will provide you an Org Chart with names and cadet ranks attached to positions. It should be clear, made available to all cadets, and published in hard copy and electronically, if possible. If your CW/CC can complete this over the summer and winter breaks, all cadet leaders can start planning for their positions well in advance.

Be sure to designate all leadership positions somehow – whether via color coding, bold, etc – and structure as close to an active-duty wing as possible.

You’ll need to ensure that each cadet holds at least one leadership position. This can be tracked via retention of Org Charts or with a leadership position tracker that lists all cadets and the jobs they’ve had.

### Job Descriptions
The regulation does not provide much guidance here, but the CW/CC must submit a description for every position on the Org Chart. A great tip is to produce descriptions that give cadets guidance on what their job responsibilities are…allowing cadet supervisors to evaluate their subordinates during feedback sessions. DO NOT include any references to fundraising. 

### Leadership Laboratory Syllabus
You will write the LLAB syllabus each semester. The more detail you can provide, the better. This is where you set out your expectations of attendance (be specific!), provide the schedule for all PT and LLAB activities, and outline the objectives to be covered by each class.

A note about grading...it’s very important to understand that there are only three things that can be considered to pass LLAB:
  -	Attendance above (80% for LLAB and 80% for PT, tracked separately)
  -	Attempting the PFA
  - Not showing indifference to training

If the above are met, the cadet should pass LLAB. If you decide to hold quizzes, midterms, or use grading for other items such as open ranks inspections, warrior knowledge, PT scores, etc. you are welcome to do so…but bear in mind that those scores are only used internally for determining awards, commander’s ranking, etc. It MUST not affect the LLAB grade of pass/fail. The reason this is important is because if the cadet fails LLAB, it either means dismissal (non-contract cadet) or a disenrollment investigation (contract cadet).

### Leadership Laboratory (LLAB)
#### Cadet Planned, Organized, and Executed...Cadre Coached
This is very important. Sure, you could probably run and execute a stellar LLAB program, but that’s not the point. If the cadre run LLAB or get too involved in the planning and execution of these cadet activities, the cadets are not learning, they will grow frustrated, and morale will plummet. You must give them latitude to plan and execute LLAB (including PT). Your job as OFC is to ensure they don’t make gigantic mistakes that spoil the experience for everyone. This done through coaching.

Whenever practical, allow cadets to track attendance, objectives, put together plans, and execute those plans. This can be difficult, especially for those of us used to diving in and taking charge—fight it! LLAB is designed to be a learning experience where cadets can grow, and they must make mistakes to grow. They can do their best through your supervision versus you completing tasks for them.

As the Ops Officer and/or OFC, you have overall responsibility for ensuring all objectives are presented and tracked, and all cadets meet attendance requirements. Objective tracking is a critical item and attendance is a significant item in the self-inspection checklist.

#### Commander’s Call LLAB
Each year, typically during the first or second LLAB of the semester (depending on whether all crosstowns are back in session), you will hold a commander’s call during LLAB. Use this LLAB to cover mandatory training (provided by the Det/CC), give cadet awards, and make cadre/cadet introductions. There are briefings available on the Holm Center Restricted Site for each topic and you can tweak them to your Det/CC’s liking. The biggest thing is to ensure you document that the cadets receive this training each year. Recommend making a Detachment Operating Instruction or CC’s guide that addresses all det policies, require cadets to read it and annotate that they understand it via a WINGS counseling.

#### Objective Accomplishment
Each cadet must accomplish the objectives associated with his/her classification (IMT, FTP, etc.) throughout the academic year. You, as OFC, must document this completion.

#### Attendance Tracking
Since attendance for LLAB and PT is one of the three things that can cause a cadet to fail LLAB, you need to monitor it closely. While you should have an Information Management Flight or Tracking Cadet (whatever your Det calls this position) oversee attendance, you need to personally oversee tracking on a weekly basis. If you don’t, it will spiral out of control quickly.

Some cadets read the 80% attendance and come to the impression that they only need to attend the minimum. Keep in mind that PMT activities (ex. PT, LLAB, AS classes, and Det/CC directed PMT) are mandatory program events. The 80% figure is only a standard to differentiate between success and failure. Any cadet who pursues minimum requirements is failing to adapt to the military training environment, one standard that can factor into “showing indifference to military training.”

#### PMT vs. non-PMT
Be very familiar with these definitions as found in AFROTCI 36-2011 vol. 3. The importance of PMT vs. non-PMT stems from whether cadets are medically covered at an event. Ensure that you brief cadets on these definitions (typically during the Commander’s Call and in your LLAB syllabus), and note every event’s classification via the OPORD. Also, know the weekly time limits for PMT and how to get deviations approved. NOTE: A cadre member must be present at all PMT events with rare exceptions like Color Guard. 

### POC Orientation
A recommendation is to conduct a POC orientation especially for the new AS300s who just completed field training. This will allow for the cadre and AS400s to establish expectations and goals early and to
36	prevent conflicts that may impact GMC motivation and retention.
 
### Physical Training (PT) Program
Initial Thoughts: Be sure to read the AFROTC Supplement to AFI 36-2905. Although you may not be the Det PTL, many requirements overlap with your training program. It will be a combined effort between you and your NCOs to complete all required actions for all cadets.

#### Participation Requirements
Before attending any PT activities during the semester, each cadet must have a physical:
  - DoDMERB Physical or Pre-Participatory Sports Physical (AF Form 28)
    - This is used to show medical qualification for PMT (PT and LLAB). Most incoming students (non-scholarship cadets) will need to complete an AF Form 28 at their own personal expense. A good idea is to send out the form over the summer as part of a welcome packet so that they can complete it with their home doctor before arriving, but it must be completed within 30-days of the start of the semester. Your scholarship cadets should have an approved or in-the-works DoDMERB physical. If still not approved, they will also need a sports physical.
  - AF Fitness Screening Questionnaire (FSQ)
    - Administer the same FSQ that all AF members complete prior to taking a fitness test. If they answer “yes” to any question, they are suspended from PT until they are cleared by a doctor. NOTE: It’s a good idea to complete the FSQ first, then request the doctor address any “yes” answers during the sports physical.

#### Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA)
The PFA is the same fitness test you take on active duty. It includes all four components and has the same minimum passing score and minimum component scores. All components must be completed within a 3-hour window unless extenuating circumstances occur, which then allows up to 5 duty days.  The new testing options are not currently being offered in AFROTC.

All cadets must be given an opportunity to take the PFA every semester; remember, if they never attempt the PFA, they fail LLAB. It is your call whether you set the PFA date for the semester or allow the cadets to come up with a date. If you set the date, include it in your LLAB syllabus and the fitness cadets can plan workouts that peak at the PFA. There is no requirement to complete a certain number of workouts prior to testing.

Any PFA failure results in a conditional event (contract cadet) or counseling session via WIINGs (non-contract cadet).  See AFROTCI 36-2011 for more PFA specific guidance.

Consider holding a make-up PFA later in the semester to test all cadets who were on PT exemption or for any PFA failures. Remind your cadets that they will not be able to compete for scholarships or enrollment allocations without an official current passing PFA score.

A cadet in/or pending MRS by HQ AETC/SG is excused from PT until the cadet’s medical condition is reviewed and the cadet is released from MRS. Cadets are also allowed a 42-day reconditioning period for the PFA once released from MRS and must complete it NLT 60 days.

#### Mixing Up Workouts
This is where your fitness cadets can really shine. The sky’s the limit…warrior runs, joint PT with Army/Navy, track/hill/stair workouts, calisthenics, etc. It is typically a good idea to hold off on team sports until after the semester’s PFA, but they add variety as well. Monitor the program and make sure cadets are getting good workouts that will prepare them for the PFA. But creativity and variety will really boost esprit de corps.
